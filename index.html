            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            Inspired by
            <a href="https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2102609">
                this post
            </a>,
            this calculator helps you to calculate the chances of getting a particular
            scenario in a character event banner. That's it.

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            Coded into this calculator is an honest-to-goodness simulator, that adjusts
            the rates of particular events (pulls) occurring based on the information it
            has. It takes into account soft pity, hard pity and guarantees.

            When these values are submitted, the scenario is played out many times, and
            the probability is obtained by taking the ratio of the number of successes
            to the number of trials.
            <h3>And what are the rates exactly?</h3>
            The chance of pulling a 5-star character is by default 0.3%. It has been
            theorized in the post linked above that after 75 pulls without a 5-star
            character, the rate changes to 32.4% (our soft pity). 
            After 89 pulls without a 5 star character, the next pull is a guaranteed
            5-star character.

            For 4-star characters, the rates are 5.1% and 51.1% for default and soft pity
            respectively. After 9 pulls without a 4-star, the next pull is guaranteed to
            be a <b>4-star and above</b>. Getting a 5-star here does not restart the
            4-star pity, so the next pull is a guaranteed 4-star or above again.
            Since the chance of getting a 4-star is affected by the 5-star pity, we need
            your 5-star pity to determine the chances of you getting a 4-star.

            Every time you get a 4-star (5-star) pull, there is a 50% chance of getting
            the featured character. If you did not get the featured character, the next
            4-star (5-star) is guaranteed to be featured.

            <h3>The calculator gives me different answers every time I run it!</h3>
            Yeah, because it works by simulating the scenario there is some natural
            variation of the results. Unfortunately, so as to not take too long, I did
            not let the calculator run too long to produce the results. Finding the right
            balance of times is quite difficult and I need some time to figure it out.

            In the mean time, if you don't feel confident about the results,
            why not run it again? :)

            <h3>This website looks quite bad...</h3>
            Yes, this is my first website ever made, and I have never touched anything
            web-related before, so cut me some slack :) I will improve on it as I learn
            more things. That might take some time though, I'm a broke college student
            after all.
